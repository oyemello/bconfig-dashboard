Here’s your prompt rewritten in the Cornell-style structure you’ve been using:

⸻

Cue:

Integrating AI — Replacing search bar with AI-powered chat drawer

⸻

Instructions / Comments:
	•	UI Change:
	•	Remove the current search bar on top.
	•	Replace it with a button consisting of:
	•	An icon:
	•	Light mode → Open-AI-black-monoblossom.png
	•	Dark mode → Open-AI-white-monoblossom.png
	•	Text: “Search with AI”
	•	Interaction:
	•	When the user clicks this button, a drawer should slide in from the right, containing a chat window.
	•	This chat is meant to help users browse Excel sheets and answer their queries by returning:
	•	Workbook name
	•	Sheet title
	•	Label name
	•	Label description
	•	The chat should allow back-and-forth conversation to clarify what the user is searching for.
	•	To narrow results, rely on:
	•	Screen label
	•	Additional field description cells — these usually contain the most relevant context.
	•	If needed, break down the user’s input to better interpret the context.
	•	Memory:
	•	The chat should retain context during the session, and only reset if the user refreshes the page.
	•	Tone:
	•	The agent’s replies should feel as human as possible.
	•	Output format:
	After understanding the query, follow these exact formats:

Single result:
Here's what you might be looking for:
Workbook: (Mention which workbook it is in)
Title: (the name of the sheet)
Label: (the name of the label)
Description: (the description of the label)

Multiple results (2 or more):
I found **X results** that match what you are looking for:
1. Workbook: (which workbook)
   Title: (sheet name)
   Label: (label)
   Description: (description)
2. ...

Rules:
- Bold only the "X results" phrase (e.g., **3 results**), where X is the number of items listed.
- Use only the provided matches (no invented values), in the provided order, and exclude destination.
- Do not repeat any header per item and add no extra commentary before or after.

	•	AI Model:
	•	Use the corporate LLM via an E2 token (no API key).
	•	Default model is `gpt-4.1`; allow overriding via `AI_MODEL`.

⸻

Summary / Additional Info:
	•	❌ Do not touch any other parts of the project — everything is already well structured.
	•	✅ Suggest changes before editing.

Would you like me to make this sound a bit more casual (like a message to your dev group), or keep it structured and professional like this?
